## Business Understanding

With the recent sure of popularity of VR chart rooms and online video-calling services, there have been more and more people using online avatars in live chats. Whether the reason is for privacy or simple fun, more people are using these avatars in calls. However, emotional expression is lost as these avatars cannot currently retain a static expression chosen upon creation, and do not actively reflect the emotional state of users. With this disconnect of emotion to expression, users are less engaged with each-other and a more distant and therefore less loyal community to your service. By implementing real time audio emotion tracking, and mapping the results to users' avatars, we can increase engagement from user to user and foster a greater sense of community within your platform, and therefore build greater customer loyalty.
